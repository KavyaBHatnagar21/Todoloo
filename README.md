Targets:
1.⁠ ⁠Start Todo Project

1. Add Task: When I type a task in the input box and click the “Add” button, the task should appear as a new item in the list. If the input box is empty, clicking the “Add” button should not do anything.
2. Mark as Completed: When I click a checkbox next to a task, the task should visually indicate it’s completed (e.g., a strike-through). I should be able to unmark the task as incomplete by unchecking the box.
	1. Show a checkbox instead of buttet point
	2. When the checkbox image is clicked then the content should get striked out and checkbox with tick will appear 
	3. If checked box is clicked again the strike should get removed and previous check box image appears

3. Delete Task: When I click the “Delete” button next to a task, it should be removed from the list.
